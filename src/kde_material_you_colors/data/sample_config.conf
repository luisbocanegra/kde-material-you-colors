# Delay after plugin change in seconds
# Some wallpapers start with a fade effect, some others like Slideshow change

# Default is 1 seconds
# Commented by default
#after_change_delay = 1

# This option makes sense for wallpaper plugins that display a live wallpaper
# or animation that never stops. This option makes the color extraction run
# only a single time instead of detecting every change.
