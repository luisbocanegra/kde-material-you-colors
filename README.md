Automatically generate light/dark color themes for KDE (and pywal if installed) from your current wallpaper, using [@T-Dynamos Python implementation](https://github.com/T-Dynamos/materialyoucolor-python) of Google's [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities)

## Installing

- Arch Linux [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kde-material-you-colors) use your preferred AUR helper (e.g `yay -S kde-material-you-colors`)

- openSUSE Tumbleweed, Fedora 40/41/Rawhide see [openSUSE Build Service repositories](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Aluisbocanegra&package=kde-material-you-colors). These might break from time to time, reach out to me if you want to help maintaining them.

### Manual install

1. Install `pipx` system packages from your distribution packages.

2. Install the backend

    **For Plasma 5** this is the last version, development has switched to plasma 6

    ```sh
    pipx install kde-material-you-colors==1.7.1
    pipx inject kde-material-you-colors pywal
    ```

    **For Plasma 6**

    ```sh
    pipx install kde-material-you-colors
    pipx inject kde-material-you-colors pywal16
    # to upgrade to newer version
    pipx upgrade kde-material-you-colors
    ```

    **Note:** You may need to install `gcc python-dbus-dev libglib2.0-dev` system packages or their equivalent for your distribution. Additionally, installing some libraries for Pillow may be necessary, see [Pillow docs](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#external-libraries)

3. Install the widget from the KDE Store [Plasma 6 version](https://store.kde.org/p/2136963) | [Plasma 5 version](https://www.pling.com/p/2073783/)

   1. **Right click on the Panel** > **Add Widgets** > **Get New Widgets** > **Download New Plasma Widgets**
   2. **Search** for "**KDE Material You Colors**", install & add it to your Panel/Desktop.

4. Install the screenshot helper. **Optional but recommended if you use other than default Image wallpaper plugin**

    **Plasma 6**

    Install `git extra-cmake-modules` system packages or their equivalent for your distribution.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/luisbocanegra/kde-material-you-colors
    ./install-screenshot-helper.sh
    ```

    **NOTE:** Helper is now installed with `/usr` prefix, reboot if you get `The process is not authorized to take a screenshot` error

    **Plasma 5**

    Install `git extra-cmake-modules` system packages or their equivalent for your distribution.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/luisbocanegra/kde-material-you-colors -b plasma5
    ./install-screenshot-helper.sh
    ```

To upgrade to a new version repeat these steps.

**Note:** When you upgrade te widget to a newer version it will inform you if it requires a new version of the backend.

## Running

You can Start and change the configuration from the widget.

### From terminal

```sh
kde-material-you-colors
```

Run `kde-material-you-colors -h` to see the list of available options (Flags take precedence over configuration file)

### Starting/Stopping Desktop entries

**If not installed by your package manager**, run `kde-material-you-colors -cl`

- To start the program launch **KDE Material You Colors** from your applications list
- To stop, launch **Stop KDE Material You Colors** from your applications list

### Running on Startup

```sh
kde-material-you-colors -a
```

#### Removing from autostart

1. Open **System Settings** > **Autostart**
2. Remove **kde-material-you-colors** by clicking on the **Trash** button.

## Configuration file

The preferred way to change the configuration is from the widget. If the configuration doesn't exist, it will be automatically created by the widget.

**Editing manually**

The default configuration file can be created by running `kde-material-you-colors -c` the location is `~/.config/kde-material-you-colors/config.conf`

Run `kde-material-you-colors` with no arguments from terminal to test your changes in real time.

Due to Qt limitations, comments are removed from the configuration file by the widget. **You can view the sample configuration file with comments [here](https://github.com/luisbocanegra/kde-material-you-colors/blob/main/src/kde_material_you_colors/data/sample_config.conf)**.

## FAQ

**Q.** How does this different from Plasma's "**Accent Color From Wallpaper**" and "**Tint all colors with accent color**"?

There are some key differences:

- Brighter accent/buttons colors
- Option to choose another color if the wallpaper returns more than one
- Can also apply colors to Konsole and pywal (both from wallpaper and custom ones)
- Colors comparison https://imgur.com/a/a28uZka (kde-material-you-colors top, default tint option bottom)

**Q.** Why there are duplicated color schemes in **System Settings**

To update color with `plasma-apply-colorscheme` (utility provided by KDE developers), the file containing the new color scheme must have a different name than the current one, to workaround that, this program creates two color scheme files with different names, then applies one after the other. As a result you end up with duplicated color schemes and maybe some lag while updating schemes.

**Q.** Can't get wallpaper colors of the default wallpaper

If you are using the default Image wallpaper plugin try changing the image to something else at least once first.

**Q.** Slideshow wallpaper (or any other Plugin) doesn't update colors correctly

Try enabling **Only use screenshot method** from the widget **Advanced settings**

**Q.** How does wallpaper detection work and why it fails sometimes?

The wallpaper is obtained in the following order:

- First, uses the [Plasma Desktop Scripting API](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/scripting/api/) to read Wallpaper plugin configuration.
- If the previous fails, the screenshot helper (if installed) is used

The backend uses the [KWin Scripting API](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/kwin/api/) and calls the screenshot helper to take a Screenshot of the Desktop view using the [KWin's Screenshot plugin](https://github.com/KDE/kwin/tree/master/src/plugins/screenshot)

Both methods are somewhat robust but there are edge cases when detection will fail, which are [explained here](https://github.com/luisbocanegra/kde-material-you-colors/issues/187)
